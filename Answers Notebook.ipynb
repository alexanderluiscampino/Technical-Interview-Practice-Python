    "So the code was chosen to be the most optimal for the problem in hands. It has complexity of O(Nlogm) since it only iterates through the entry string once. There are two sort functions applied, once to the string t, which if it is large, will take some time, this has complexity O(NlogN). But in most cases string t will be short and not cause much problems. Also, there is a need for a second sort function on the substring from main string. This will have the same length as the string t, so sorting can take some time. This sort will also occur several times throughout the routine. Se if S is length 8 and t is length 2, this sort will occur 4 times total.\n",

    "The complexity of the algorithm above will be O(N^2 / 2) because there is a nested loop and necessarily we have to iterate through all the string everytime. This is the simplest form I found to to make this routine work on the spot, it is still functional and easy to understand. The choice for nested loops was due to be the most logical solution to look within a string for substrings that are palindromes. Since every 2 letter combination can be a palindrome, all possible combinations of letters within the string will have to be tested. For example, the string abcba will have the following breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iteration: 0 -> a\n",
    "* Iteration: 1 -> ab\n",
    "* Iteration: 1 -> ab\n",
    "* Iteration: 2 -> abc\n",
    "* Iteration: 3 -> abcb\n",
    "* Iteration: 4 -> abcba\n",
    "* Iteration: 5 -> b\n",
    "* Iteration: 6 -> bc\n",
    "* Iteration: 7 -> bcb\n",
    "* Iteration: 8 -> bcba\n",
    "* Iteration: 9 -> c\n",

    "* Iteration: 12 -> b\n",
    "* Iteration: 13 -> ba\n",
    "* Iteration: 14 -> a\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the Complexity of the Algorithm will be exactly O(1/2*N*(N+1)) where N is the length of the String. This is better than O(N^2) by almost 50%.\n",

    "Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search tree. The least common ancestor is the farthest node from the root that is an ancestor of both nodes. For example, the root is a common ancestor of all nodes on the tree, but if both nodes are descendents of the root's left child, then that left child might be the lowest common ancestor. You can assume that both nodes are in the tree, and the tree itself adheres to all BST properties. The function definition should look like question4(T, r, n1, n2), where T is the tree represented as a matrix, where the index of the list is equal to the integer stored in that node and a 1 represents a child node, r is a non-negative integer representing the root, and n1 and n2 are non-negative integers representing the two nodes in no particular order.

Although, the `class BST(object):` has a couple extra functions not needed for this answer, but I included them for the sake of completness. I chose to create two classes, `node` and `BST`. The Node class will just include the vlue of the Node and if It has a subnode to the Right or Left. If this it he casem subnode will be class *Node*. \n",

This include the function `lca` which will return the Least Common Ancestral, which is the value of the Node that is common to both *n1* and *n2*. This Algorithm takes advantage of the way binary search trees are buit. Where all subnode values larger to the node are pushed to the right and smaller to the left. This makes it very easy to search for values within the tree, making the search time of linear complexity.\n",

Other cases will be if n1 and n2 are both smaller or large, then we can advance on step deeper on the tree, and make a new root with the node at that step. This cycle will continue until n1 is larger than root, and n2 smaller or vice-versa.\n"

    "Given a linked list, find the value of the element mth positions from the end of list. The problem with this situation is that on a linked list, we do not know the total length of the list to start with. Linked lists are basically a vlue with  pointer to the next value. So we do not know all values on the list, just the next one, given any value. This is done to save time and memory space. In comparison, if we just store  whole list, we can always aaccess the mth element from the end using `list[-mth]` making this exercise rather trivial. \n",
